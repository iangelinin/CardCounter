My idea is to get more experience in computer vision and web development with Python 
and automate the part of a Belote game that I find the most anoying.
   -I will start by setting up a simple web app that players can use to keep track of 
   the result and other aspects of the game. The main purpose of this is for me to get to know 
   the Django web framework
